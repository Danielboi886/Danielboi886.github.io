## Question for this week

1. In the code from this week's assignment [here](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/JavaScript/blob/main/Week2/practice-exercises/solutions/5-who-wants-a-drink.js), the concept of double "for loop" is shown, but I still can't figure out how this double loop works. Also, I've tried multiple ways of solving it, which is [here](https://github.com/Danielboi886/JavaScript/blob/main/Week2/practice-exercises/5-who-wants-a-drink.js) this one. It didn't work out and I was wondering which part I did wrong.

2. I am still not very sure about how forWhich() is used.
