# HYF HTML Projects
 This is the admission portfolio to Hack Your Future Program. In this page I tried to create page for my own interior design studio. The page is written in HTML and pure CSS. 
 
 A few techniques I used in this page: 
 
 1. Scroll Snapping. Very useful letting users view your page in full or create a pure CSS carousel. 
 2. Picture tag. Very useful in responsive designs.
